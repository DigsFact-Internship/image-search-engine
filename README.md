# Image Search Engine
Image Search Engine utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze and index millions of images quickly and accurately. It employs machine learning to understand context, content, and aesthetics for improved search results. 

## How it works?
An image search engine works by employing a combination of techniques and algorithms to analyze, index, and retrieve images based on user queries. Here's a simplified overview of how it works:

1) Indexing: The image search engine crawls the web, scanning and analyzing images it encounters. It extracts various visual features from the images, such as color, shape, texture, and patterns. These features are then used to create an index, which is essentially a large database of image representations.

2) Query Processing: When a user enters a search query or uploads an image, the search engine processes the query and extracts relevant information. Text-based queries, it identifies keywords and filters that can help match the query to images in the index. For image-based queries, it extracts visual features from the uploaded image to compare and find similar images in the index.

3) Ranking and Relevance: The search engine utilizes sophisticated ranking algorithms to determine the relevance of images to the user's query. It considers factors such as keyword relevance, visual similarity, image quality, and contextual information. The engine assigns a relevance score to each image and presents the most relevant ones at the top of the search results.

4) Filtering and Refinement: To enhance the user experience, the search engine often offers filtering and refinement options. Users can specify image properties like size, color, aspect ratio, or license type to narrow down their search results further.

5) Copyright and Licensing: Image search engines respect copyright and intellectual property rights. They employ various mechanisms to filter out copyrighted images or provide licensing information for images that can be used commercially or under Creative Commons licenses.

6) Continuous Improvement: Image search engines often leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to continuously improve their performance. They learn from user interactions, feedback, and user-generated data to enhance search accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction over time.

Overall, image search engines combine visual analysis, indexing, query processing, ranking algorithms, and user-centric features to provide users with a comprehensive and efficient way to search and discover images online.

## How to build it?

1) Use this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karimabdulnabi/fruit-classification10-class) to download the fruit dataset.
2) Based on your approach you might keep the images in the same folders or gather them in one folder.
3) Use any Deep learning model to get the image vector. Hint [You can use a pre-trained model] Hint [Consider AutoEncoders, Vgg, or Resnet]
4) Implement one of [these](https://towardsdatascience.com/17-types-of-similarity-and-dissimilarity-measures-used-in-data-science-3eb914d2681) similarity and dissimilarity measures.
5) Use the same Deep learning model to query the test image.
6) Show the results.
